</p>

## Overview
Generate [jsdoc][jsdoc] `@link` [inline tags][jsdoc-inline] from `@npm` inline tags.

e.g., `{@npm jsdoc-plugin-npm}` => `{@link https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc-plugin-npm|jsdoc-plugin-npm}`

If you'd like to predefine links in a configuration file to make them referenceable see the [url JSDoc plugin][url-plugin] .

## Usage
Given the following example:
```javascript
// example npm package (not real...yet)
const voightKampffMachine = require('voight-kampff-machine');
/**
 * Takes an array of questions and returns a Promise that resolves to a `string` response to those questions.
 * Depends on the {@npm voight-kampff-machine} package.
 * 
 * @function voightKampff
 * @since 1.0.0
 * @param {string[]} questions
 * @returns {Promise<string>}
 */
const voightKampff = questions => {
	return voightKampffMachine.handleQuestions(questions)
		.then(response => {
		  if (!response) {
		    return 'They\'re only questions Leon';
		  }
		  return response;
		});
};
```
`jsdoc-plugin-npm` will generate:
````javascript
/**
 * Takes an array of questions and returns a Promise that resolves to a response to those questions.
 * Depends on the {@link https://www.npmjs.com/package/voight-kampff-machine|voight-kampff-machine} package.
 * 
 * ...
 */
````

## Installation
Install as a [devDependency][dev-deps]:
```bash
npm i -D jsdoc-plugin-npm
```

## Setup
In your [JSDoc config][jsdoc-config] in the [plugins][jsdoc-plugins] array include:
```json
{
  "plugins": ["jsdoc-plugin-npm"]
}
```
That's it!
